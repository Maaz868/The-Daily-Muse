# The Daily Muse

The Daily Muse is a React-based blogging platform designed to empower bloggers by providing a supportive and inclusive environment. Our mission is to foster a sense of belonging, creativity, and growth within our community. The platform features user authentication, intuitive navigation, and allows users to create, edit, and delete blog posts with updates managed by a JSON-server database. Key components include blog cards, a welcome page slider, headers, and footers. Using React hooks like useState and useEffect, it ensures a seamless, user-friendly experience that amplifies bloggers' voices.
